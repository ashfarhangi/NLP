Most NLP problems requires a specific type of NLP model. In order to make your
life simpler I’ve added various State-of-Art NLP models and provided step by
step tutorials to complete your project, paper and research rapidly.

=====================

Let’s face it, nobody likes to edit a paper 100 times. Currently, we can use NLP
to suggest the next few sentences of scientific papers. This is a good start

is very general and it gives you good suggestions for next sentences.
